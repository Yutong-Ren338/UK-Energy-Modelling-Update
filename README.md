### UK-Energy-Model-with-CO2-Removal

This repository contains the Python codes and datasets for a simple 2050 UK Energy Model.

### Getting started

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies with `uv`:

```bash
uv install
```

Run tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Check code style with `ruff`:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

### Data Sources

See [src/data/README.md](src/data/README.md) for data sources.
