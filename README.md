# UK Energy Modelling with CO2 Removal

A Python-based energy system model for simulating the UK's 2050 net-zero energy transition with integrated Direct Air Capture (DAC) capabilities.

## Overview

This model simulates the UK's future energy system using hourly/daily time series data with the following key capabilities:

- **Renewable energy generation** from wind and solar with realistic ERA5-based capacity factors from Renewables.ninja
- **Multiple demand scenarios**: Switch between naive scaling, seasonal patterns with heat pump electrification, and CCC CB7 2050 projections
- **Energy storage systems** with configurable capacity and round-trip efficiency losses
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC)** integration for CO2 removal using excess renewable energy
- **Economic analysis**: Cost modeling and optimization capabilities (in development)

## Getting Started

Install dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
uv install
```

Run tests to ensure everything works:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Check code style:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```


## Development Status

### Current Capabilities
- âœ… Core power system simulation with storage
- âœ… Multiple demand modeling approaches 
- âœ… Renewable supply modeling with capacity factors
- âœ… DAC integration for excess energy allocation
- âœ… Transmission/distribution losses (11.3% total)

### Planned Enhancements
- ðŸ”„ Hourly time resolution (currently daily)
- ðŸ”„ Interconnector modeling (28 GW capacity by 2050)
- ðŸ”„ Dispatchable low-carbon generation (gas + CCS)
- ðŸ”„ Medium-term storage options (pumped hydro, compressed air)
- ðŸ”„ Economic optimization and cost modeling

See `todo.md` for detailed development roadmap.

## Data Sources

Historical weather data from ERA5, renewable capacity factors from Renewables.ninja, and demand projections from the CCC Seventh Carbon Budget. See [src/data/README.md](src/data/README.md) for complete data source documentation.
